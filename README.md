Promises demo in node.js
A promise is just an enhancement to callback functions in Node.js. During the development lifecycle, there may be an instance where you would need to nest multiple callback functions together. This can get kind of messy and difficult to maintain at a certain point in time. In short, a promise is an enhancement to callbacks that looks towards alleviating these problems.
Promises can be nested within each other to make code look better and easier to maintain when many asynchronous function need to be called at the same time.
